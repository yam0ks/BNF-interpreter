## About:books:
The formal grammar of the source language is described using the Backus-Naur form. The translation tool consists of a lexical analyzer,
a syntactical analyzer and a generating part. The lexical analyzer searches for lexical errors and converts the program text into tokens.
The syntactical analyzer matches the sequence of tokens against the formal grammar, looking for syntax errors. Finally, the generating part executes the program.
